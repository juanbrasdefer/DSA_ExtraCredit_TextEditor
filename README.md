# Positional List Text Editor
Extra Credit Assignment

for Juan Brasdefer and Fabian Pawelczyk



## note: I simply did not have the time to finish implementing this, and my testing of functionality shows that the cursor doesn't move. Apologies! As it is an extra credit assignment, I need to cut my losses and focus on looming exams. Enjoy anyway, and thanks for the challenge! :)

Instructions:
Write a simple text editor that stores and displays a string of characters using the positional list ADT, together with a cursor object that highlights a position in this string.

A simple interface is to print the string and then to use a second line of output to underline the position of the cursor.

Your editor should support the following operations:

• left: Move cursor left one character (do nothing if at beginning).
• right: Move cursor right one character (do nothing if at end).
• insert c: Insert the character c just after the cursor.
• delete: Delete the character just after the cursor (do nothing at end).
